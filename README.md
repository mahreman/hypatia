Hypatia - A hardware-agnostic computation language and virtual machine, built on Geometric Algebra and symbolic first principles. We're redefining computing by treating it as a mathematical ideal rather than a physical process.

Vision: To overcome the limitations of the von Neumann architecture and the unsustainable costs of modern AI training by creating a more elegant and efficient paradigm for computation.

✨ Key Features
Geometric Algebra Core: A unified mathematical language for intuitive modeling of geometric and physical problems.
Hardware Agnostic: The HypatiaVM acts as a "Platonic ideal," with backend renderers for CPUs, GPUs, and future neuromorphic chips.
Native Sparsity & Symbolic Optimization: Fundamentally sparse data structures and symbolic differentiation for drastic reductions in computational overhead.
Dynamic Activation Graphs: Brain-inspired networks that activate only necessary pathways.
