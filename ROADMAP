## Join the Journey

This roadmap is a living document that will evolve with community input. The path is ambitious, but each step is concrete and achievable with collective effort.

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Finalize Phase 0 deliverables
2. Recruit initial core contributors
3. Begin prototyping Geometric Algebra primitives

The future of computation won't be built by waiting—it will be built by doing. Let's begin.
